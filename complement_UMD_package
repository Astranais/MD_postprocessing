Theses scripts are additional post-processing scripts I developed as a complement of those available in the UMD package (https://github.com/rcaracas/UMD_package/releases/tag/1.0.0)

They can be used by everyone without modification (or maybe with only a few)

For a complete explanation of the options and the operation of the scripts, see my thesis manuscript
(link to hal archive when published)
