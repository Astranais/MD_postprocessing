# MD_postprocessing
All the scripts I used in my thesis work to post-process VASP data. 
You can find some scripts from the UMD package (https://github.com/rcaracas/UMD_package/releases/tag/1.0.0) and others I have developed myself. 

4 folders with specific scripts or files inside:
  o DataFilesExamples/
    - Contains some data files used or created by the scripts in the other folders.
  o complement_UMD_package
    - Contains additional post-processing scripts I developed as a complement of those available in the UMD package (https://github.com/rcaracas/UMD_package/releases/tag/1.0.0)
    - They can be used by everyone without modification (or maybe with only a few)
    - For a complete explanation of the options and the operation of the scripts, see my thesis manuscript available at https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03046733
  o from_UMD_package
    - The scripts present in this folder are from the UMD package before its first release (available on https://github.com/rcaracas/UMD_package/releases/tag/1.0.0)
    - Small differences in the format, coments or additional features may exist between the scripts given here and those from the first official release.
    - Please use the official release https://github.com/rcaracas/UMD_package/releases/tag/1.0.0
    - And if you use the code, while waiting for its publication in a scientific paper (later this year), please cite it using its DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3710978
  o misc_visualization
    - The scripts presented here are all the scripts used to create the figures presented in my thesis manuscript or article
    - Most of them are specific to my files, mainly due to the naming rule I used to simplify the post-processing.
    - You are free to use them or part of them for you own data analysis.
